					<h3>Wicker Park - Protecting the Wild Life </h3>
					<p>Because wicker Park is located in the middle of the city, there aren't that many species. However, it's very important that we protect the few that still inhabits among us. We work very hard on feeding and providing shelter to different bird and duck species. </p>

					<h3> Wicker Park - Cleaning and Awareness </h3>
					<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people don't respect public and green area. Butis none of us take action to prevent our living areas to become more and more polluted, we'll just live in a dirty and unhealthy environment. We're always working on bringing awareness to different issues related to the environment and we've seen a clear improvement (in terms of pollution in our parks) over the past years.</p>
